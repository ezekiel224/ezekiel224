# Hi,
My name is Zeke and all I want to do is make my life easier. I develop tools that aid in my work and personal life. Nothing I do is ground breaking, nor am I a master in Python, Batch, Powershell or anything really. I just like to learn and apply what I have learned in the real world. Some of my tools are useless, others are just cool to watch. But some,my favorites, make certain tasks faster or in a perfect world automated.

## Current Projects
While I personally believe that information should be free and open to everyone, most of my work must remain private. Most of my work is realted to other companies and must be kept private to protect them but also protect myself. That being said, I will keep this page updated with my personal tools or other small projects I work on. Some of which include: 

- **Python** - File sorter
- **Python** - Phone to mouse Gyro-Controls
- **Batch** - Return old context menu
-
